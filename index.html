  <h1>I'm Ash Barrett.</h1>

  <p>I have a large interest in finding the pathways to enact the most change at a global scale. I affirm that this is done through technology and its governance.</p>

  <p>I was a rising junior at <a href="https://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a> studying Political Science and Philosophy (4.0 GPA) when I dropped out to build <a href="https://www.build.ai/">Build</a> as the Chief of Staff.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We believe that large-scale 3D world data will solve embodied AI.</li>
    <li>We’re backed by Hf0, Abstract Ventures, Pear VC, ZFellows, and other great partners.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I am the president of <a href="https://www.sigmaetapi.org/">Sigma Eta Pi</a>, UCLA's Premier Co-Ed Professional Entrepreneurship Fraternity. We host YC founders, HFO residents (me), ODF fellows, Techstars founders, and KP fellows who have raised a collective $1.2B (partially me).</p>

  <p>I wrote policy and commentary on digital and technological governance for <a href="https://www.dentons.com/en/">Dentons</a>. It is currently hard-copied in Antitrust Reviews in the Czech Republic.</p>

  <p>I give back weekly at a local level with <a href="https://uplift.org/">Uplift</a>. I also built and am launching a service for NPOs to streamline volunteer sourcing.</p>

  <p>I did <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nivo-home/">sales</a> and debate. If I can't sell, I will just keep talking.</p>

  <p><em>I want to learn. I want to have asymmetric impact.</em></p>
